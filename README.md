# Xgboost-Flask-automation

![plot](./assets/dataset-cover.jpg)

## Description
In this repo I build a xgboost model that predicts the earning of a taxi ride based on the dataset:  
[NYC Yellow Taxi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/microize/newyork-yellow-taxi-trip-data-2020-2019)  

- The very simple EDA,  training and initial predicting is done through notebooks.  
- In the deploy directory we will have code to deploy this Xgboost model and serve it in a flask server with the option to use docker containers.  
- .yml provides code for CI/CD
